//Section 1
//1) A parameter is a variable accepted and used by a function.  Parameters are named when a function is declared
//An argument is a value that you pass to a function when you call it.
//2) Console.log simply logs values to the developer console.  Return will serve as the output of a function to be
//used in other parts of your code later.
//3) A function returning a value means that function can be used later on in your code to affect other logic.
